# AI-Enabled Ethical Decision Support for Leukemia Care

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

This project proposes an AI-powered, ethically aligned, and socially inclusive platform for **dynamic leukemia treatment planning**, which adapts to real-time patient data and balances between curative and palliative care. By leveraging **Ethical AI**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Clinical NLP**, the system empowers clinicians with transparent, data-driven insights to make ethical and patient-centric decisions.

##  Problem Statement

Leukemia care presents several challenges:

- Complex data interpretation (blood tests, genetics, history)
- Emotional, ethical, and financial dilemmas
- Balancing curative treatment vs. quality-of-life care
- Lack of inclusivity in existing AI solutions

---

##  Key Features

### 1. **Diagnosis & Data Processing**
- Classifies leukemia types using lab reports, genetic markers, and clinical notes
- Uses ClinicalBERT to extract medical insights from unstructured records

### 2. **Personalized Treatment Planning**
- Suggests curative or palliative plans based on health, age, finances, and ethical parameters
- Generates alternative treatment simulations

### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring & Adaptive Adjustments**
- Continuously updates recommendations using new vitals and symptoms
- Leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) for reinforcement learningâ€“based optimization

### 4. **Transition Between Curative & Palliative Care**
- Ethically and legally guided transitions when curative treatment is no longer viable
- Prioritizes dignity and patient autonomy

### 5. **Prognosis & Quality of Life Assessment**
- Predicts survival outcomes and long-term well-being
- Dynamically adjusts care goals to optimize life quality

### 6. **Ethical & Financial Transparency**
- Detects unethical suggestions (e.g., overtreatment or consent violations)
- Recommends cost-effective care based on financial conditions

### 7. **Doctor-Patient Decision Support**
- AI proposes; clinicians validate and execute treatment
- Interactive support improves doctor efficiency and patient trust

##  Architecture

- **ClinicalBERT**: Processes structured/unstructured medical data
- **Ethical AI**: Rule-based ethical and legal compliance checks
- **MLP Classifier**: Flags unethical recommendations
- **DQN Agent**: Optimizes treatment over time with Q-learning
- **Weighted Aggregation Layer**: Balances curative and palliative care factors

##  Datasets

- **MIMIC-IV** â€“ ICU patient records
- **Leukemia Kaggle Dataset** â€“ Image and diagnosis data
- **PubMed + NIH Bioethics** â€“ Clinical notes and ethical literature
- **Ethical Synthetic Dataset** - Ethical Policies and Compliances 

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- **NLP**: ClinicalBERT, spaCy
- **Reinforcement Learning**: DQN
- **Compliance**: GDPR/HIPAA policy-check libraries

##  Impact

- Reduces clinician burnout and cognitive overload
- Improves patient outcomes and autonomy
- Makes leukemia treatment affordable and accessible
- Bridges gap in care equity across socio-economic classes
